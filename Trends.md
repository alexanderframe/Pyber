Urban cities dominate the Pyber market.  They are tops in Total Fare (62.7%), Total Rides (68.2%), and Total Drivers(86.7%).  
This makes sense as urban areas not only have more people than suburban and rural areas, but it is also more likely that someone living in an urban area would not have a car and need to use Pyber than it would be to find a similar person in a suburban or rural area.


Despite each city type's total fare percentage being more or less the same as their total rides percentage (with urban percentages being 62.7% and 68.2%, respectively), urban cities' percentage of total drivers jumps up to 86.7%.  This leads me to believe that while total fare and total rides seem to be correlated, an increase in drivers does not necessarily mean an increase in rides.


When looking at the bubble plot, it seems that the average fare of a ride increases as the total number of drivers per city decreases.  Not only does this fit into basic supply and demand, but it could be due to rides being longer and thus more expensive in more spread out rural/suburban places.
